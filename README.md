# Trial Work Period Calculator

## Overview

There are 12 million people receiving Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), a program that the US government provides individuals with income to cover housing, utilities, food, and other essentials costs of living.

## Description

Ticket to Work program incentivizes beneficiaries who return to the workforce. After starting employment, they continue receiving benefits during a Trial Work Period. This is a window up to 9 months where they can make an unlimited amount of income before they loss their benefits. There are no tools that give beneficiaries the date that they will loss benefits. This results in overpayment where the government will expect 100% recovery. Trial to Work Period calculator returns a date that users can expect to loss benefits. This prevents them from being overpaid by the government.

## Assumptions

- Users enrolled in Ticket to Work program through United States Social Security Administration
- Users know the date that they began employment
- Users monthly income equals or exceeds \$1,110
- Users income wonâ€™t change for 9 consecutive months
